# Automating Project
Let's create project automatic
# Idea
I try to create this simple project in order to create a project, up it to github, remove it from github automatic.
# How to use
After clone this project, let add .my_commands.sh and .setup.sh to ~/.bashrc permanently. Then, move to create.py and config your own folder to contain your project, add your account. To setup, type:
```bash
    cd your/Directory/AutoProject
    sh .setup.sh
```
### To use it
```bash
    create NewProject # Create a project names NewProject
```
This Project allow you to create a Project with README.md, src, docs, report and .gitignore, then push it in a new repository in GitHub, which name the same with your new project's name.
